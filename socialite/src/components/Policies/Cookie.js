                  <h1><center><b>Cookie Policy</b></center></h1>

We employ the use of cookies. Cookies are small pieces of text used to store information on web browsers. Cookies are used to store and receive identifiers and other information on computers, phones and other devices. Other technologies, including data that we store on your web browser or device, identifiers associated with your device and other software, are used for similar purposes. In this policy, we refer to all of these technologies as "cookies".
<br /><br />

While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Peersity Products, we use them for the following purposes:
<br /><br />
<ol>
<li><b>Authentication and General Browsing</b></li>
We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you're logged in so that we can make it easier for you to access the Peersity Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.
<br />

For example: We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Peersity Pages. Cookies also help us remember your browser so you don't have to keep logging in to Peersity.
<br /><br />

<li><b>Security, site and product integrity</b></li>
We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Peersity Products safe and secure.
<br />

For example: Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Peersity account without authorisation, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been hacked.
<br /><br />

<li><b>Public Q&A Platform (Querify)</b></li>
We use cookies that support and enhance our public Q&A platform by enabling important functionality. Such activity includes tracking and attributing activities and badges.
We use cookies to validate the authenticity of persons attempting to gain access to a specific user account, enable the core platform of community-generated questions and answers, including diagnosing and resolving issues within our Q&A platform and identify individual users to attribute activities and awards.
