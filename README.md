# SocialIIIT: A Social Network Exclusive for IIIT-H

## Project Overview

A social network is a dedicated application which enables users in a certain social group to communicate with each other and make new connections. In IIIT-H, almost all clubs and students depend on Facebook posts, Instagram Stories and various other platforms to announce their events and interact with acquaintances in the college for various activities such as cab sharing, looking for seniors, etc. This forces them to manage multiple media accounts even though what people actually need is a *what happens in IIIT, stays in IIIT* base.

We have built such a social app, accessible to everyone inside IIIT-H, putting almost all IIIT-H related online social interactions under one umbrella. Here is an overview of the most prominent features that we have implemented in this webapp so far:

* ### Friend Recommender System

This is the social part of SocialIIIT where we recommend friends to users and enable them to expand their network from the comfort of their homes. Freshers can make connections quickly and easily with minimal effort and its need will be even more pronounced in an online semester. It also enables introverts to make friends by removing the anxiety involved in offline world. Meets with friends and others can be set up to catch up or get to know each other. Notifications are sent as well for both friend and meet requests.

* ### Querify

This is a common platform for everyone to ask queries to anyone at IIIT. Everyone can answer according to their own capability and best answers will be rewarded accordingly in terms of rating and points. It helps to promote knowledge and gain from experience of your seniors. Reporting/rating reduction have been implemented to limit spam and unwanted content.

* ### Ratings and Gratitude Points

Every user will have an associated rating which starts at 1000 and increases/decreases according their usage of the platform and the quality of their answers. Gratitude points are also awarded to an user if his/her answer is upvoted. They act as a scale to measure their proficiency in a particular skill.
